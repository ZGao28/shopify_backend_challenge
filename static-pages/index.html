  # shopify_backend_challenge
  For the Shopify 2019 Winter Backend Challenge
  <br>
  <br>
  ## API Design and Thought Process
  I built all the APIs around what I thought would be useful and realistic for an actual app.
  <br>
  <br>
  E.G. 
  <br>
  You cannot add line item to order if that line item is not in products
  <br>
  Adding a line item to order results in decrease in stock of line item in products
  <br>
  Before I started working on any of the backend, I created a quick UX/UI diagram, and labeled things that would be required for the backend to do. I was going to also throw together a quick front end with React but ran out of time.
  <br>
  1. Create a shop, with name and description
  <br>
  2. Ability to add, edit, remove, get products and orders once shop is created
  <br>
  3. Ability to add and remove line items to products and orders once they exist
  <br>
  <br>
